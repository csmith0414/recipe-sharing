        "title": " Martha Stewart: Soft and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies",
        "ingredients": "2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature, ½ cup granulated sugar, 1 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 2 large eggs, 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips (2 cups)",
        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350°F with racks in the upper and lower third positions. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together flour and baking soda; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and both sugars on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add salt, vanilla, and eggs; mix to combine. Reduce speed to low. Gradually add flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Mix in chocolate chips. Using a tablespoon measure or a small ice-cream scoop, drop heaping portions of dough about 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.",

        "title": "Gordon Ramsay Filet Mignon",
        "ingredients": "Filet steaks, Garlic, Oil",
        "instructions": "Remove the fillet steaks from the refrigerator 30-60 minutes before cooking. Unwrap, season, and place on a counter plate. Do not omit this step for the best results. Preheat the oven to 360°F once you’re ready to cook. For 3-5 minutes, heat a medium cast iron skillet over high heat. When the oil is heated, carefully pour it in (watch out for splatters). Sear the Filet Mignon for 2-3 minutes per side (1-2 minutes per side for Petite Filet Mignons), or until browned and crusty. Remove the skillet from heat immediately. Add butter, garlic, and rosemary to the skillet with care. Bake for 2-8 minutes, depending on the desired doneness (see notes for internal temperatures; remove skillet from oven once the internal temperature is 5-10°F below the desired temperature). As a general guideline, 5 minutes will give medium-rare fillet steaks. 3-4 minutes for medium-rare fillet steaks 2 minutes produces rare fillet steaks. 6-7 minutes for medium-well and 8 minutes for well-done fillet steaks The precise timing is determined by the weight and thickness of your Filet Mignon. Place the steak on a platter after removing it from the pan. Tent with foil and set aside for 5-10 minutes (do not skip rest). Serve with garlic cloves and skillet butter.",
